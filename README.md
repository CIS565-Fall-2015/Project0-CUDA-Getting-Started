## Part 6: Write-up

1. Update ALL of the TODOs at the top of this README:
   * Remove all of these instructions, so that your README
     represents your own project, rather than the assignment. You can always
     read the instructions on the original GitHub page.
   * Add your name, computer, and whether it's a personal or lab computer.
   * Embed the screenshots you took. (`![](images/example.png`)
   * Syntax help: https://help.github.com/articles/writing-on-github/
2. Add, commit, and push your screenshots and README.
   * Make sure your README looks good on GitHub!
3. If you have modified either of the `CMakeLists.txt` at all (aside from
   the list of `SOURCE_FILES`), you **must** test your project in Moore 100B.

## Submit
1. Open a GitHub pull request so that we can see that you have finished.
   The title should be "Submission: YOUR NAME".
2. Send an email to the TA (gmail: kainino1+cis565@) with:
   * **Subject**: in the form of `[CIS565] Project 0: PENNKEY`
   * Direct link to your pull request on GitHub
   * In the form of a grade (0-100+), evaluate your own performance on the
     project.
     (N/A for Project 0.)
   * Feedback on the project itself, if any.

And you're done!
